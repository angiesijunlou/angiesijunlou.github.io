		<div id="introduction">
		<span class="firstcharacter">S</span>ince 2009, over 140 indigenous Tibetans have set themselves on fire in retaliation against the Chinese state that occupies their land and psyches. This page is a compilation of all details I could find related to the lives they led, the people they loved, the suicide letters they wrote, and the last words they spoke. These are the records that have emerged despite China's attempts to erase traces of their bodies through cremation, and these are the stories that have been told despite the silence of the Great Firewall.
		<br>
		<p>This project is a small tribute to the the true heroes of Tibet, the ones who have made the greatest sacrifice for the freedom of their people. Through these portraits we can understand what it means to resist colonization using the physicality of the body, and how this resistance can outlast the mortality of the Self.
		<br>
		<p>The parable of the Buddha and the Hungry Tigress is ritually cited by Tibetan monks when they are asked if their defiance is in contradiction to Buddhist philosophy. The story is told like this: in one of Buddha's past lives, he came across a hungry tigress in the woods who was about to devour her children. The Buddha saw this and, without hesitation, sacrificed his own life in their place. In this one fluid act, the Buddha showed a divine detachment from the physicality of his body and a love for the vitality of all creatures. Although it is against his teachings to inflict harm upon the self, it is vindicated when this sacrifice is an act that alleviates collective suffering.
		<br>
		<p>The firmness of this conviction is captured by the last words of 20-year-old martyr Pawo Tsultrim, who set himself on fire on 1 January 2012. <i>"We have no saviors or protectors,"</i> he said. <i>"Brothers and Sisters of the Snow Land: Unite for Tibet."</i>

		<div id="historyheadline">a history of self-immolation</div>
		<div id="history">
			<span class="firstcharacter">T</span>ibet's sovereignty has been interrupted by a series of colonizations from East Asian empires, but the Tibetan people and their ancestors have remained loyal to The Dalai Lama and the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) since the 17th century. Their leadership was abruptly overthrown when the People's Republic invaded in 1959. Since then, the Dalai Lama and the CTA fled to Dharamsala, India and have been living there, in exile, for over five decades. 
			<p>Today, there are more foreign journalists allowed in North Korea than in Tibet. This staggering secrecy makes any leak vital to understanding the climate of their exile. Since the People's Republic's invasion, China has committed acts of political repression, economic marginalization, environmental destruction, and cultural assimilation against native Tibetans. One million Tibetans have been killed as a direct result of the occupation, and there are now more Han Chinese people than Tibetans living in many parts of the country. 99 percent of Tibet's monasteries have been destroyed in an effort to expunge religion, and the country's freshwater resources have been monopolized and now supply billions of people throughout Asia. Intellectual property is also under strict surveillance: you can be tortured for flying a Tibetan flag or owning a photo of the Dalai Lama.
			<p>The People's Republic has been met with much resistance against its cultural genocide. Self-immolation is a longstanding tradition that has been practiced by Buddhists for many centuries; in times of relative prosperity and peace, monks have abolished the body by feeding themselves to insects or drowning themselves in holy waters to manifest an Enlightened separation of the body and spirit. The earliest recording of self-immolation as a political protest dates back to the 7th century, in China, when five monks revolted against the religious persecution rampant in Emperor Wu's reign by setting themselves on fire.
			<p>Self-immolation in modern retaliation against the Chinese state has several signature markings. The martyr often douses themselves in gasoline and embeds themselves in a location that is geographically significant: a temple, a nunnery, a police station, a government office, a shrine. The previous day can be unceremonious; loved ones are not signaled of the impending suicide to prevent brutal interrogation by the police after the martyr's death. After they set themselves on fire, they reveal the reasons for their sacrifice by shouting "Long live the Dalai Lama" and "Unite for the Snow Land" until they are engulfed in flames.
			<p>Since 2009, there have been over 140 instances that follow this script. While we honor the individual martyrs and the conditions of their captivity, we must also extract the universal message they are sending to the world outside of the one their oppressors have made for them. We can hear its echo from across the ocean: Tibet will be free.
		</div>

		<div id="theoryheadline">taking back the body from the colonizer</div>			
		<div id="theory">
			<span class="firstcharacter">M</span>any of the non-profit organizations that claim to be working towards Tibetan independence are based in America and Europe: celebrities like Paris Hilton tweet "#FreeTibet" while the Gorillaz hold live aid concerts in their name, but many of these acts are nothing more than void performances of altruism. They occur without an intricate understanding of Tibetan histories, martyrs, and diasporas, and this reduces their struggles and afflictions to a hashtag. Therefore we must look deeper to avoid commodifying their lives with a Western, liberal conception of human rights.
			<p>It's important to recognize that China and America are involved in a perpetual competition for global empire, and the discourse of human rights that exists between them is also a manifestation of this rivalry. They each summon the other's condemning record without acknowledging the atrocities committed by their own state. We must make it clear that when we criticize the colonization in Tibet, we also criticize the colonization of Palestine, Tanzania, Nicaragua, Fiji, and all nations in the Third World striving for liberation.
			<p>There is a vital distinction that Black Panther Huey P. Newton makes between revolutionary suicide and reactionary suicide. In the West, the act of killing oneself is often seen as a sign of the individual's trauma rather than a method to alleviate collective suffering; it is always destructive, never constructive. American newspapers often write about martyrdom with a tone of condescending pity: "One woman's tragic path to self-immolation," "A desperate act of terrorism," "The burning question: bravery, or wasted life?" But many of these martyrs' suicide letters emphasize that without freedom in Tibet, <i>there is no difference between life and death.</i> This shows that the substance of life is measured not only by the physical but also by the metaphysical; the death of the body does not translate to a death of the being. If we prescribe to a Buddhist cosmology where death is a portal to reincarnation and immortality, then we can honor these martyrs the way the Tibetan people honor them: with respect for what is sacred.
			<p>Bodies under colonialism are riddled with scars made by the colonizer. Therefore, the self-destruction of this body is a form of vandalism. After the martyr's suicide, the Chinese state and the local Tibetan people often struggle for custody over the remains; the indigenous people form a circle around the martyr to protect them from being cremated by the police. Many monks wrap themselves in barbed wire in order to prevent this cremation, which is an erasure of their revolt. Since a dead body does not pose a security threat, it is clear that the martyr's charred body is a symbol of their refusal to submit. In this way, the body itself is a combat zone. Through the destruction of it, the martyr escapes the rule of the colonizer and is liberated.

  		  		<p>34-year-old Sangyal Khar set himself on fire in front of the police station in Amchok Town. A Tibetan source said that Khar's charred body was taken to Sangchu County by the Chinese police who refused to hand over the body to his family despite protests from the local Tibetans. The situation in Amchok town remains tense as authorities cordoned off the area and put restrictions on local people's movement and communication lines. Sangyal Khar became the 134th Tibetan to immolate themselves in protest of the Chinese occupation, and the 114th martyr of Tibet.

  		  		<p>22-year-old Tsering Tashi is the first Tibetan to set himself on fire in 2013. His body was removed from his home by authorities and cremated in the middle of the night before his family had a chance to carry out traditional prayer rituals.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>A harrowing video of his protest surfaced and showed Tsering Tashi lying on the street in flames, lifting his hands into a prayer position and saying the name of the Dalai Lama. According to relatives of Tsering Tashi who are now in exile, the authorities threatened the family after his self-immolation, with one official accusing them of having close ties with the "splittist Dalai group."

  		  		<p>The Chinese administration in this province has offered a bribe for information on anyone linked to Tibetan militancy.Any informant will be given more money than any government official makes in a year. At the same time, a police block has caused media and foreigners to be banned from entering Tibet as a method for isolation.

  		  		<p>The 18-year-old monk Lobsang Lobzin self-immolated inside the Tsodun Kirti Monastery north of Barkham county. After he set himself on fire in the monastery's main assembly hall, he attempted to walk towards the township's government office in protest. His body was cremated later that evening.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>As Chinese forces began to make their way to the monastery, local Tibetans gathered to form a human shield in order to prevent them from proceeding. This shield aims to prevent the forcible removal of monks, which occurred in the Kirti Monastery in Ngaba the previous year.

Both monks have previously studied in Kirti Monastery in Ngaba, where many monks who have self-immolated this year originate from. In the aftermath, 100 monks gathered at the hospital where the young monks were being treated.

  		  		<p>She wrote a suicide note and left it in an envelope prior to her self-immolation. It states: <i>"There is a photo of mine in the memory card. Here is the will for the photo.

  		  		<p>The 30-year-old nomadic Tibetan woman named Rechok set fire to herself in front of Jonang Dzamthang Monastery, Barma. She died at the scene and her body was held in the monastery as many Tibetans gathered for her cremation. This self-immolation comes only three days after two Tibetans committed martyrdom in Tibet's capital, hundreds of miles away.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>Rechok spent her last days in the mountains tending to her family's animals and then travelled to the town, prepared to give her life. She is the fourth of young lay people who have set themselves on fire in Barma in 2012 in protest of the occupation of Tibet.

  		  		<p>24-year-old Sonam and 25-year-old Choephak Kyap were cousins who committed a twin self-immolation in front of the Jonang Dzamthang Monastery. Both men died and were ordered by authorities to cremate their bodies at 1 a.m. local time. Several thousand Tibetans gathered at their cremation site. A voice recording was found two days after their death. They said their actions were not for personal glory, but instead for <i>"the freedom of Tibet, for the development of Buddhism, and so sentient beings can prosper, and for world peace."</i> In addition, they said: <i>"We, the Tibetan people, suffer without our human rights. The suffering Tibetan people experience due to the denial of our freedom is much greater than the suffering of setting my body on fire."</i>

After Nangdrol's protest, local Tibetans took his body to the monastery where Buddhist rituals were carried out. In a handwritten note he left behind, he said: <i>"Head raised high with national pride and courage, I will give my life to fire."</i>

She committed ritual suicide at the Kardze Monastery after circling the area several times and praying to a sacred object. Yeshi Khando was a nun at the Chokri Ngagong nunnery in Kardze. She called for the return of the Dalai Lama, his long life, and for the freedom of Tibet. Her protest took place close to Kardze's prison and police station. Police arrived immediately and carried her body away in a vehicle, refusing to give custody of it to her relatives.

Tibetans who witnessed the protest immediately took his body to the nearby Gongthel monastery for prayers before the Chinese police could arrive at the scene.

Chinese have arrested three nuns from this same monastery, whose whereabouts remain unknown. At this time, Chinese president Xi Jinping was visiting Europe with no mention of Tibet from his hosts.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>Dolma belonged to the well-known Thonglaka Tsang family in Bathang, with three rinpoches (senior religious figures) in the family. This family is known for their involvement in fighting against the Chinese invasion in the 1950s. Various family members have been either killed or imprisoned, including Dolma's father.

Radio Free Asia reports: "[While he burned], he called out for Tibet's complete independence." There are also media reports that "He raised slogans calling for Tibet's complete independence." A candle-lit vigil was held in McLeod Ganj, attended by hundreds of Tibetans and supporters. Radio Free Asia has reported that Wangdu's family are being pressured by local authorities to say he died in a house fire.

  		  		<p>19-year-old Dorje Tseten and 25-year-old Dargye set their bodies on fire outside of Jokhang Temple, regarded to be one of Tibet's holiest shrines. This is the first self-immolation in Lhasa, Tibet's historic capital. Their martyrdom took place during Saga Dawa, an important religious period for Tibetan Buddhists that commemorates the Buddha's birth, enlightenment, and death.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>The self-immolations are the first in Lhasa, where Chinese security has been tight since March 2008, when protests occurred across Tibet and rocked the capital city. The media reported today that Lhasa’s Public Security Bureau has set up a special task force to investigate the case.

  		 		<p>27-year-old monk Tsesung Kyab set fire to himself in front of the main temple of Shitsang Gonsar Monastery. At the time, many Tibetans had congregated at the monastery for a special prayer ceremony and ritual during which monks carry the Buddha's statue while circling the monastery. Tibetans struggled with Chinese security personnel who attempted to extinguish the flames and remove Tsesung's body. The bystanders were able to take his body to his home in Choekhor village for prayers and the cremation ceremony. Several hundred Chinese armed police arrived at the monastery and imposed restrictions in the area. It is believed that Tsesung Kyab is a cousin of Pema Dorjee, who set himself on fire and died at the same location in December 2012.

  		  		<p>23-year-old Tibetan monk Pema Dorjee committed ritual suicide by setting fire to himself in front of the Shetsang Monastery in Luchu County. This day on the lunar calendar is observed as Gaden Ngamchoe, the day of Je Tsongkhapa's Parinirvana. Tibetans observe this day by offering lamps in monasteries, temples, and stupas to venerate the mortal departure of Lama Tsongkhapa, a great 14th century Tibetan Buddhist master. Sikyong Dr Sangay, the elected head of the Tibetan people, urged Tibetans and supporters to <i>"light a candle or lamp, observe a minute's silence, and a say a prayer for all those who have died for the cause of Tibet, and locally organise vigils and rallies."</i>

  		  		<p>A series of protests have taken place over Tibet, underlining a broad rejection of China's 60-year-old occupation and widespread abuse of Tibetan bodies, including routine and widespread torture and surveillance.

  		  		<p>38-year-old Dawa Tsering from the Kandze Monastery poured kerosene on his body and set himself alight during a masked Cham dance festival, attended by hundreds of local people. He shouted for the return of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the freedom of Tibet. The Chinese police doused his body, but he resisted medical attention.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>The monks from his monastery prevented Dawa from being taken away and interrogated by the large numbers of Chinese police. They have been stationed at the monastery since the nation-wide protests since 2008.

Kelsang is the brother of Phuntsog, the 21-year-old monk who set himself on fire in March. This is the fourth act in the last six months. The state tried to douse the flames and remove them from the scene.

  		  		<p>In the afternoon of March 11th, Phuntsog from the Kirti monastery set himself on fire in Ngawa County, Sichuan province. After his death, over 1,000 monks sat outside the gates of his monastery in protest against the state. The Chinese government sentenced three monks to prison for helping Phuntsong with his suicide.

  		  		<p>23-year-old Tibetan woman Tamdin Tso set herself on fire in her family's winter pasture near the Gemar market in Rebkong. She siphoned petrol from a motorbike, drank it, then doused herself in it. She was the mother of a young boy. Her body was taken back to the family home where several thousand local people gathered to pray.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>Her protest came after visiting Dowa town and becoming angered by Chinese government propaganda which reiterated the ban on pictures of the Dalai Lama and called on Tibetans to stand up against those calling for separatism.Over  two-thirds of Tibetans who have self-immolated are under 25 and have grown up strictly under Chinese rule.

  		  		<p>25-year-old Dorjee Lhundup set himself on fire on Taglung South Street, some kilometers west of Rongwo Monastery. His body was taken to Dolma Square and a crowd of thousands of Tibetans converged to pay their respects. His body was cremated immediately to prevent authorities from interfering.

  		  		<p>The cremation took place at the same site where two other men who self-immolated in Rongwo were cremated earlier in 2012. These revolutionary suicides have sparked the largest protests in Tibet since 2008. Latest reports indicate that Chinese security forces have swamped the streets in Rongwo, placing restrictions on the movement of Tibetans.

  		  		<p>40-year-old Sonam Dargye, a close friend of the martyr Jamyang Palden, self-immolated in Rongwo Town only three days after Palden's suicide. Sonam travelled from his village and stayed in a hotel overnight. Upon waking, he washed himself, prayed, and then drank petrol. He walked outside the hotel, set himself on fire and shouted: <i>"Let His Holiness return to Tibet!"</i> while engulfed in flames.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>Sonam had wound his torso with barbed wires, a tactic that had been earlier used by self-immolating monks to prevent the state from taking away their bodies. Locals carried his body to Dolma Square where 8000 Tibetans paid their respects and marked their protest against the government.

  		  		<p>Tashi Kyi set herself alight in her home village in Sangchu County. Around dawn, police came to her house in Ngulra village and forcefully took away her body. Tashi Kyi's protest followed the demolition of houses in Ngulra with bulldozers because they did not have valid permits. A number of the house-owners protested, with some physically hanging on to the demolition equipment. Ngulra residents believe Tashi Kyi’s self-immolation was motivated by witnessing the destruction of her village.

  		  		<p>18-year-old Sangay Tashi set himself on fire in Sangkog town and passed away at the scene. He is the sixth Tibetan to commit a ritual suicide in protest of the state in the last three days. He called for the return of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the release of all Tibetan political prisoners, including the Panchen Lama.

  		  		<p>The Panchen Lama vanished from the public eye shortly after being named at aged six. It has been claimed that Gedhun had been taken into protective custody from those that would spirit him into exile and is now held in captivity against the wishes of the Tibetan people, whereas the Chinese government claims that he is living a "normal" private life.

An eye witness reported people on the street encircled him to prevent government forces from taking away his body. Local Tibetans then carried it back to his home in Sertri village.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>Tsewang Kyab is the second person in Sangchu on this day to demonstrate his fierce rejection of Chinese rule, and the fifth Tibetan this week to die in lone protest against the occupation. The Chinese national newspaper Xinhua reported a differing account of this suicide.

  		  		<p>27-year-old Lhama Kyab, a farmer in Bora Village, set himself on fire, fought off Chinese police officers who attempted to douse his flames, and then ran towards the Bora Monastery. He shouted demands for the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet. Following his self-immolation, a fight broke out between the guards and the local Tibetans who succeeded in carrying Lhamo Kyab's charred body inside the monastery's prayer hall.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>Bora Monastery was also the scene of major protests against Chinese rule on 20 March 2012. More than 100 monks marched to government buildings, displaying Tibetan flags and pictures of the Dalai Lama.

  		  		<p>35-year-old Tenzin Gyatso died after setting himself on fire outside of a government building in which "political education" was taking place. The Chinese government is implementing measures to enforce patriotism in Tibet, including educating monks about Chinese nationalism.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>This self-immolation is also in protest against a massive deployment of security forces in Tawu County, where Tibetans had been planning to celebrate the 80th birthday of His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

  		  		<p>35-year-old Palden Choetso, a Tibetan nun from the Geden Choeling Nunnery, self-immolated in protest of China's rule over Tibet. She was heard shouting <i>"Tibetans will reunite soon"</i> and "long life for His Holiness the Dalai Lama" before setting herself aflame.
				<br>
				<p>Palden died at the scene and her body was taken to Nyitso Monastery, the monastery of Tsewang Norbu, the martyr that died on 15 August. The area was under lock-down after the protest, with the closing of a major road in Tawu and the deployment of troops to the nunnery. A candlelight vigil was held in her honor.

  		  		<p>29-year-old Tsewang Norbu set himself on fire on the Chume Bridge in the center of Tawu. Norbu drank and sprayed himself with petrol, then said: <i>"We Tibetan people want freedom"</i> and <i>"Let the Dalai Lama return to Tibet."</i> After his death, telephone lines were cut in an effort to stop the news from spreading to the outside world, and the Chinese army surrounded the Nyitso Monastery.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>The monastery's water and electricity supply has been cut repeatedly since they organized a birthday celebration for the Dalai Lama, despite a ban by the local authorities. Thousands attended this celebration. The state has vowed to track down the ringleaders. Norbu's committed suicide only months after Phuntsog's self-immolation in March.</quote></div>

He was also a member of the Democratic Management Committee, the government-controlled body the authorities rely on to control the monasteries internally. Tamchoe had asked the Chinese police to leave because it is a place for monks and not police officers, but his requests were ignored.
  		  		<br>
  		  		<p>After his death, a military checkpoint stationed outside the monastery was used to prevent from entering or leaving. The checkpoint was placed to watch after the monks' daily activities after a patriotic re-education was instated there.

  		  		<p>37-year-old Sangye Tso set herself alight at the entrance gate of a government office close to Chubu Shi monastery in Chone County. Afterwards, her nephew Tenzin Sopa was arbitrarily arrested and his whereabouts remain unknown. China's authorities told the monastery that anyone who posts any information related to Sangye Tso's death will face heavy punishment or expulsion. Before self-immolating, Sangye Tso offered incense in front of a photo of the Dalai Lama; text was discovered in Tibetan below the portrait which said, <i>"Long Live His Holiness the Dalai Lama", "Where is His Holiness the Panchen Lama", "Tibet needs Freedom."</i> Local police went to Sangy Tso's home and ordered the family to say that she died of natural causes.
